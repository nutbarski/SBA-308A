This weather application uses OpenWeather's Weather API https://openweathermap.org/api

This is a simple app that takes a user inputted city name and pulls the relevant weather data (Weather Condition, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed)

There isn't much going on in this app other that it takes the raw weather data and converts it into Imperial measurements, as well as detecting the weather condition and applying an image to express it.

Simple Data Validation comes into play in the form of just not accepting invalid city names and throwing an error. The nice part is that it hides any undefined/placeholder data just to make things look more professional!
